    <b>AutoFFT is a high-performance FFT library for ARM and X86 processors</b>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Faster than FFTW, ARMPL, and Intel MKL, especially for non-power-of-two radices;</li>
      <li>Propose a template-based framework to autogenerate FFT kernels of natural-number radices;</li>
      <li>Particularly optimize <b>radix-2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13</b> kernels for ARMv8 and X86-64 (Intel and AMD) CPUs, sizes of the form 2<sup>a</sup>3<sup>b</sup>5<sup>c</sup>7<sup>d</sup>11<sup>e</sup>13<sup>f</sup> are much faster than other sizes;</li>
      <li>Realize O(nlogn) algorithms for arbitrary input sizes of complex/real data, including prime sizes;</li>

    <b>HartSift is an efficient SIFT implementation on GPUs. It realizes high-performance feature extraction by making full use of computing resources of CPUs and GPUs</b>
    
    <ul>
      <li>HartSift is 55.88~121.99 times, 5.17~6.88 times, and 1.25~1.79 times  faster than OpenCV SIFT, SiftGPU, and CudaSift respectively;</li>
      <li>Propose two efficient optimizations (rebalancing workloads and multi-granularity parallelism) to address load imbalance among threads (inter-warp workload imbalance and intra-warp workload imbalance) when porting SIFT to GPUs;</li>
      <li>Introduce two high-performance histogram algorithms based on GPUs (the warp-based histogram algorithm and the atomic-free histogram algorithm) to rapidly accumulate information on different scales of samples.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>PerfCV is a cross-platform and high-performance basic algorithms library for computer vision and image processing</b>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Support basic image processing algorithms, such as Resize, Cvt_color, GaussianBlur, WarpAffine, WarpPerspective and so on;</li>
      <li>Adopt SSE/AVX/NEON intrinsics to accelerate these algorithms on X86 and ARM CPU platforms. The CPU version of this library is 1.29~35.10 times faster than OpenCV;</li>
      <li>Use CUDA to implement these algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs. The GPU version of this library is 1.27~2.17 times faster than OpenCV.</li>
    </ul>
